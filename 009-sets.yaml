# In Kubernetes, there are two main types of sets used to manage pods:

# ReplicaSet:

# Purpose: Maintains a stable set of replica pods running at any given time.
# Usage: Ensures a specified number of identical pods are always available.
# Management: Typically managed indirectly through Deployments.

# StatefulSet:

# Purpose: Manages pods that require persistent storage or stable network identities.
# Features:
# Assigns unique, sticky identities to each pod.
# Guarantees the ordering and uniqueness of pods.
# Provides stable network identifiers for each pod.
# Supports persistent storage for each pod.

# Use Cases: Stateful applications like databases, message queues, etc.

# Additional Notes:
# Deployments: A higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets, providing features for rolling updates and rollbacks.
# DaemonSet: Ensures a copy of a pod runs on each node in the cluster.
